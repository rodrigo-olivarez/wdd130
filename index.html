        <h1>Rodrigo Olivarez | WDD 130.</h1>

        <p>I'm Rodrigo Olivarez. I was born in Veracruz but currently live in Mexico City. I've been preparing for a
            bright future.
            I'm 22 years old and ready for the tests. I love cats, and I'm learning more and more about what it means to
            have companionship in life. I served as a missionary in Mexico City and had experiences that helped me
            understand my purpose. I'm always willing to
            help, even when I lack knowledge. I'm cheerful and enjoy going for walks or exercising. My favorite season
            will always be winter because you feel the love of people more and there are Christmas carols that
            sound very nice and relax the soul.
            I'm good at listening but bad at making friends; I always try to be the
            best I can be to earn friends. Every day at work I find new ways to talk and conversations to have, I love
            cats and I always feel good with them
            because they are very cute and loving like a child.</p>
