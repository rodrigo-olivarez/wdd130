        <p>I'm Rodrigo Olivarez. I was born in Veracruz but currently live in Mexico City. I've been preparing for a
            bright future.
            I'm 22 years old and ready for the tests. I love cats, and I'm learning more and more about what it means to
            have companionship in life.</p>
